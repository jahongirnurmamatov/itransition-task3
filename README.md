#Dice Game with Fair Random Protocol
##Overview
This is a command-line dice game where two players (you and the computer) select dice, throw them, and determine the winner based on the outcome. The game includes a Fair Random Protocol to randomly choose which player starts the game, using HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) to ensure fairness.

##Features
- **Fair Random Selection**: The computer selects a random value and the user must guess it to determine who goes first.
- **Dice Selection**: Both players choose their dice, each with different values.
- **Game Flow**: Players take turns throwing dice, and the winner is determined by comparing the dice results.
- **ASCII Table Display**: The result of the game ("I win" or "You win") is displayed in an ASCII table, making the outcome more prominent.

##Requirements
- **Node.js**: This project requires Node.js to run. You can download it from here.

- **Dependencies**:

    - `chalk`: For colorful terminal output.
    - `ascii-table`: To create and display ASCII tables.

You can install the dependencies by running:

##Example Output
When you start the game and make your guess:

```
Let's determine who makes the first move.
I selected a random value in the range 0..1 (HMAC=4b54d0406599d603cbb4f66d1d06dc6aa080392d0349ecbf58acb76736a00853).
Try to guess my selection.
0 - 0
1 - 1
X - exit
? - help

Your selection: 1
My selection: 1 (KEY=5d10012844f975cc38b657d3c596ec78fc7c2edd95988d82c5698b512f2f87d8).
You guessed correctly! You make the first move.
```
After the game ends, the winner message is displayed in a table:
if you win
```YOU WIN! ðŸŽ‰ (8 > 5)!````
or
```I WIN! ðŸ˜ˆ (8 > 4)!``` 
in case you lose
or 
```It is a tie```
in case of tie.
